Hereâ€™s a rephrased version of your message:

Hello Everyone,

I am excited to share that I have successfully completed a Power BI project with PwC on the Forage platform.

Throughout the project, I tackled three tasks, each resulting in a distinct Power BI report, and I am pleased to announce that I have successfully finalized the entire project.

You can view the project on the Forage website here: https://www.theforage.com/simulations/pwc-ch/power-bi-cqxg
