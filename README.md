Hereâ€™s a rephrased version of your message:

Hello Everyone,

I am excited to share that I have successfully completed a Power BI project with PwC on the Forage platform.

Throughout the project, I tackled three tasks, each resulting in a distinct Power BI report, and I am pleased to announce that I have successfully finalized the entire project.

You can view the project on the Forage website here: https://www.theforage.com/simulations/pwc-ch/power-bi-cqxg

Additionally, here is my certification: https://forage-uploads-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/completion-certificates/PwC%20Switzerland/a87GpgE6tiku7q3gu_PwC%20Switzerland_qmdXxjcyBrRNuoZ3k_1679391357133_completion_certificate.pdf
